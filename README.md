Deployment instructions

This repository is configured to deploy the static site to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions. The workflow triggers on push to the `main` branch.

How it works:
- Push your changes to `main`.
- GitHub Actions will build/upload the contents of the repository root to GitHub Pages.
- The site will be available at: https://mirtimur.github.io/27-pocker-club

If the URL doesn't work after a few minutes, go to the repository Settings → Pages to check status.
